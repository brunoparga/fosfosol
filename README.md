# Fosfosol

`Fosfosol`, named after an arcane pharmaceutical concoction that's supposed to aid memory, is a connector between an Anki flashcard deck and a Google Spreadsheet. The idea is to allow several students in a language class to all add words to the spreadsheet and then each generate flashcards to use on Anki.
